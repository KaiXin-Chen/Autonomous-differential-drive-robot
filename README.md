# Autonomous-differential-drive-robot
## Basic info
This is the course project for Stanford cs237a (principle of robot autonomy) class. Contributors are Hao Li, Ran Li, Kaixin Chen and Zhengyang Wei. We employed the "ASL turtlebot" package built by the course instructors and implemented a variety of function to achieve autonomous motion in some enviroment. Note that because of the requirments of the Stanford honor code, the code cannot be made public, so please contact me if you want to learn more about the project.
## Result overview
First we you gazebo and rViz to simulate and manually manipulate the robot in a unkown map. As the map is unkown, the person manupulating should help robot avoid unseen obstacles at this stage.
After the map is fully known, the
